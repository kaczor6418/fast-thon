## Description

This repository contains a boilerplate to start building an app prototype and focuses on implementation of business
logic of the idea for your app. All configuration like **DB connection**, **CDN storage**, **authentication**, **build
pipeline**, **deployment**, **static code analysis** is ready to use, so you do not have to spend time on configuration
of your project.

## Philosophy

When I was attending hackathons, I always lose time to set up my whole environment before I actually started
implementing my idea. I have decided that I want to have a boilerplate that will have a preconfigured connection with
DB, CDN storage, Authentication, build pipeline… . In the future, it is possible I will extend this boilerplate with
features that I will be missing during hackathons.

## What's inside

- Configured connection with **_[Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)_**
- Configured connection with **_[Cloud Storage for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage)_**
- Functions for authentication **_[Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)_**
- Improved types for firestore
- Configured **Firestore**, **Firebase Storage** and **Firebase Authentication** emulators
- Configured deploy pipeline
- Configured CI/CD pipeline
- Configured TanStack Router
- Full PWA support
- Theme toggle
- Configured **_[i18n](https://www.i18next.com/)_**
- Configured **_[MUI](https://mui.com/)_** with prepared files inside **_`./src/mui`_** open for your changes in theme,
  typography...
- Configured **_[Eslint]()_** and **_[Prettier]()_** with set of rules that you can adjust to your needs

## Using the repository

### Connecting with Firebase project

Once you downloaded the repository, you need to set and synchronize your Firebase project name with this repository.
Otherwise, deploying firestore rules, storage rules, page deployment and CI/CD pipeline can end with errors. You can
find the project ID in **_Project settings_** tab.

![image info](./docs/pictures/firebase-project-id.webp)

Then you need to run below command with project-id that you have found.

```
npm run firebase:link-app fast-thon-49c51
```

### Setting-up CI/CD

To make GitHub actions work you need to generate your personal Firebase API token and attach it as a secret inside you
repository.

**What you need to do:**

1. Open Firebase [console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) in your web-browser
2. Navigate to your **_Project setting_** ![image info](./docs/pictures/firebase-project-settings.webp)
3. Navigate to **_Service accounts_** ![image info](./docs/pictures/firebase-service-accounts.webp)
4. If you do not have **_Service account_** yet, you should see a button to **_Create service account_**
5. In Firebase Admin SDK find **_Generate new private key_** button and click it
   ![image info](./docs/pictures/firebase-generate-key.webp)
6. Firebase Admin SDK Key should be generated and download to your disk in `.json` format
7. Now open GitHub with fork/copy of **fast-thon** repository
8. Open **_Setting_** tab ![image info](./docs/pictures/github-settings.webp)
9. Find **_Secrets and variables_** section in left navbar and choose **_Actions_**
   ![image info](./docs/pictures/github-secrets-actions.webp)
10. Find **_New repository secret_** button and click it ![image info](./docs/pictures/github-create-secreat.webp)
11. As **_Name_** of your secret put **_`FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`_**
12. Inside **_Secret_** area put content of Firebase Admin SDK `.json` file you have generated
13. Click **_Add secret_** button
14. Now you should be redirected to list of your secrets, and you should see new secret in the list
    ![image info](./docs/pictures/github-firebase-sdk-secret.webp)
15. Now GitHub actions should work

### Running project

To run this project locally make sure you are in root directory of **fast-thon** repository, and you have installed all
dependencies:

```
npm i
```

Then you should attach your existing Firebase project to this repository:

```
npm run firebase:init
```

Then you need to start Firebase emulators first:

```
npm run firebase:start:emulators
```

> Emulator UI should be available under **_[http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/)_**

Then in separated terminal you need run the application:

```
npm run start
```

> App preview should be available under **_[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)_**
